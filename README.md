## PROJECT TOPIC: Analysis of Product Uptake for different accounts in TAJBank [Download Here](https://tajbank.com)

### Project Overview
To analyze Product Uptake for different accounts in TAJBank, weâ€™ll need to approach the problem in a structured way. This involves looking at how different customer segments (e.g. by account type) adopt the various Bank's products (e.g. Qard, Qard Savings, Mudarabah Savings, Mudarabah Term Deposit and Mudarabah Current Account products).

### Table of Content


#### Outline

1. Define the Scope
First we clarify what matrices shall be used to determine product uptake:

- Is it new product enrollment?
- Is it usage frequency?
- Is it activation versus non-activation?
- Timeframe (monthly, quarterly, annually?)
- Accounts to be compared (e.g., Qard, Qard Savings, Mudarabah Savings, Mudarabah Term Deposit and Mudarabah Current Account products)
- Product categories (e.g., Qard and Mudarabah)

2. Gather and Prepare Data
Next, weâ€™ll need a dataset with at least the following fields:

- Customer ID
- Account type
- Product type
- Date of product uptake
- Status (active/inactive)
- Demographics (optional: age, income, location, etc.)
- Revenue from each product per account
- Cross-sell / up-sell history

3. Key Metrics to Analyze
Here are key performance indicators (KPIs) to consider:

Metric	Description
Product Uptake Rate	% of accounts that have adopted at least one product
Average Products per Account	Total number of products Ã· total accounts
Product Penetration Rate	% of accounts that have each type of product
Cross-sell Rate	% of accounts with >1 product
Time to First Uptake	Average time from account opening to product adoption
Churn Rate by Product	% of accounts closing products over time

ðŸ”¹ 4. Segmented Analysis
Analyze uptake across different account types:

Example:
Account Type	Credit Card Uptake	Loan Uptake	Insurance Uptake	Avg Products/Account
Savings	35%	15%	10%	1.6
Business	60%	55%	30%	2.8
Student	45%	5%	3%	1.3

ðŸ”¹ 5. Visualization Ideas
Bar charts: Product uptake per account type

Heatmaps: Cross-sell behavior between products

Line graphs: Trends over time in product adoption

Funnel chart: Conversion from account opening â†’ first product â†’ second product, etc.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Insights and Recommendations
From the above analysis, you can extract actionable insights:

Which account type has the highest cross-sell potential?

Are there underperforming segments for certain products?

Do specific account types show early uptake trends?

What promotional or onboarding strategies might boost uptake?

ðŸ”¹ 7. Optional Advanced Analytics
Predictive modeling: Use machine learning to predict likelihood of product uptake based on customer/account features.

Cohort analysis: See how uptake varies by customer onboarding cohort.

Survival analysis: Model time to product adoption or churn.
